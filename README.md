# Facebook-Unread-Message-Notifier
To cause a light to turn on when there is an unread Facebook message of a certain user

My code is not perfect and can be tweaked to greatly improve its current reliability and speed. To that end hack away and tinker with it as much as you like.

The code is very particular as I used absolute file paths for everything because I was having trouble getting it to run properly without them.

I have made two versions
1. the unedited code. The code used for a raspberry pi to make an led lightup.
2. Just the logging into the facebook page function and returning if a message is there.

got the phantomjs for armv6 from https://github.com/spfaffly/phantomjs-linux-armv6l
